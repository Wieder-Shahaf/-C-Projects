    <h1>C Project Repository</h1>
    <p>
        This repository contains various C programming exercises aimed at building foundational skills in data structures, algorithm design, and optimization. Each exercise addresses a different computational problem, with specific requirements for implementation, performance, and complexity. The exercises are designed to deepen understanding of C syntax, efficient memory usage, and algorithmic thinking.
    </p>
    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Union of Sets (`print_union.c`):</strong> Implements a function to find the union of two integer arrays, representing mathematical sets. The union operation ensures that only unique elements from each array are included in the result.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optimized Union for Sorted Sets (`print_union_sortedArrays.c`):</strong> An efficient version of the union function designed for pre-sorted arrays, allowing for a more streamlined computation by leveraging sorted order.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Intersection of Sets (`print_intersect.c`):</strong> This function computes the intersection of two integer arrays, outputting elements that are present in both sets without duplicates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optimized Intersection for Sorted Sets (`print_intersect_sortedArrays.c`):</strong> A performance-focused intersection function that operates on sorted arrays, allowing for faster matching of common elements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Difference of Sets (`print_diff.c`):</strong> Computes the difference between two arrays, returning elements that are present in the first array but absent in the second.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Exact Change Calculator (`change_regular.c`):</strong> Implements an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to return exact change using various coin denominations. It includes edge case handling for instances where exact change may not be possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Array Copy (`copyarray.c`):</strong> A function that creates and returns a new copy of an integer array, handling memory allocation to ensure data integrity in the copied array.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Array Sort (`sort_arr.c`):</strong> Sorts an integer array without modifying the original, returning a new, sorted version of the array. This function is implemented to handle standard sorting complexities and performance requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Set Operations with Linked Lists (`set_operations.c`):</strong> Implements a comprehensive set of functions for mathematical set operations using linked list data structures. This includes union, intersection, and difference operations on sets, along with initialization and printing functionalities. The implementation ensures no duplicate elements and maintains proper memory management while handling various edge cases.
